# Guessing game

This one was a lot of fun to make. It also inspired me to creating my very <a href="https://martinfjeld.github.io/math-game/">first project</a> on my own. The game is simple: a random integer between 1 and 20 is stored, and the game is to guess it! For every time you guess it wrong, your score shrinks down by one. It also shows your highscore.
